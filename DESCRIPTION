Description: Provides a framework which should improve reproducibility and transparency in data processing. It provides functionality such as automatic meta data creation and management, rudimentary quality management, data caching, work-flow management and data aggregation.
    * The title is a wish not a promise. By no means we expect this package to deliver everything what is needed to achieve full reproducibility and transparency, but we believe that it supports efforts in this direction.
